Plugin to make those annoying mistyped capitalised commands go away!

Now you don't have to worry if you accidentally hit :Wq - it will act just like :wq
No messing with remappings or abbrevations either!

Commands fixed

### Installation
I recommend installing using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

Add `Bundle 'takac/vim-commandcaps'` to your `~/.vimrc` and then:

* either within Vim: `:BundleInstall`
* or in your shell: `vim +BundleInstall +qall`
